# In Viewport

Check if any part of an element is in the viewport.

## API

### inViewport(element, [border])

```js
var inViewport = require('in-viewport')

var el = document.querySelector('img')

if (inViewport(el, window.innerHeight / 2)) {

} else {

}
```

`element` is the element you want to check.
`border` is the number of pixels outside the viewport you want to check.
For example, to check whether an element is within `200px` of the viewport, you do `inViewport(element, 200)`.
